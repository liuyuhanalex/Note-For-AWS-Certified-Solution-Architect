Exam tips:
1. Your VPC automatically comes a default network ACL, and by default it allows all outbound and inbound traffic.
2. You can create custom network ACLs. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
3. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated with the default network ACL.
4. Block IP Addresses using network ACLs not Security Groups.
5. You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed.
6. Network ACLs contain a numbered list of rules that is evaluated in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule.
7. Network ACLs have separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.
8. Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).
