Identity Access Management Roles

Attach the role to an EC2 instance:
Actions-> Instance Settings ->Attach/replace IAM roles

Exam tips:
1. Roles are more secure than storing your access key and secret access key on individual EC2 instances.
2. Roles are easier to manage.
3. Roles can be assigned to an EC2 instance after it is created using both the console & command line.
4. Roles are universal - you can use them in any region.
