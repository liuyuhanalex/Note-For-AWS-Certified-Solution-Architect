RDS - Back Ups, Multi-AZ & Read Replicas

Automated Backups are enabled by default. The backup data is stored in S3 and you get free storage space equal to the size of your database.

DB Snapshots are done manually. They are stored even after you delete the original RDS instance, unlike automated backups.

Whenever you restore either an Automatic Backup or a manual Snapshot,the restored version of the database will be a new RDS instance with a new DNS endpoint.

Read Replicas are available for the following databases:
(1) MySQL Server (2)PostgreSQL (3)MariaDB (4)Aurora

Things to know about Read Replicas:
1. Used for scaling, not for DR!
2. Must have automatic backups turned on in order to deploy a read replica.
3. You can have up to 5 read replica copies of any database.
4. You can have read replicas of read replicas(but watch out for latency.)
5. Each read replica will have its own DNS end point.
6. You can have read replicas that have Multi-AZ.
7. You can create read replicas of Multi-AZ source databases.
8. Read replicas can be promoted to be their own databases. This breaks the replication.
9. You can have a read replica in a second region.

Exam tips:
There are two different types of Backups for RDS:
1. Automated Backups
2. Database Snapshots
