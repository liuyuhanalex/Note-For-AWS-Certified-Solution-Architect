Lambda
AWS Lambda is a compute service where you can upload your code and create a Lambda function. AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code. You don't have to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc.

What Languages Does Lambda Support
1. Node.js
2. Java
3. Python
3. C#
4. Go
5. PowerShell

What is Lambda Cool?
1. No SERVERS
2. Continuous Scaling
3. Super super super cheap!

Exam tips:
1. Lambda scales out(not up) automatically
2. Lambda functions are independent, 1 event = 1 function
3. Lambda is serverless
4. Know what services are serverless!
5. Lambda functions can trigger other lambda functions, 1 event can = x functions if functions trigger other functions.
6. Architectures can get extremely complicated, AWS X-ray allows you to debug what is happening.
7. Lambda can do things globally, you can use it to back up S3 buckets to other S3 buckets etc.
8. Know your triggers.
