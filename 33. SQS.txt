Amazon SQS
Amazon SQS is a web service that gives you access to a message queue that can be used to store messages while waiting for a computer to process them.
Amazon SQS is a distributed queue system that enables web service applicationts to quickly and reliably queue messages that one component in the application generates to be consumed by another component. A queue is a temporary repository for messages that are awaiting processing.

Exam tips:
1. SQS is pull based, not pushed based.
2. Messages are 256KB in size.
3. Messages can be kept in queue from 1 minute to 14 days; the default retention period is 4 days.
4. Visibility Time Out is the amount of time that the message is invisible in the SQS queue after a reader picks up that message. Pdrovided the job is processed before the visibility time out expires, the message will then be deleted from the queue. If the job is not processed within that time, the message will become visible again and another reader will process it. This could result in the same message being delivered twice.
5. Visibility timeout maximum is 12 hours.
6. SQS guarantees that your messages will be processed at least once.
7. Amazon SQS long polling is a way to retrieve messages from your Amazon SQS queues. While the regular short polling returns immediately(even if the message queue being polled is empty),long polling doesn't return a response until a message arrives in the message queue, or the long poll times out.
